What you'll learn

How to limit the number of critical resources requested by your webpages

How to optimize your critical rendering path 


Turn your critical rendering path into a runway

Any resources that appear before the body of the page and can therefore interfere with the page loading are "critical" resources.


Optimize in four steps

Analyze

Minimize 

When Javascript files aren't needed for the initial render, use the ASYNC and DEFER options to take them off the critical rendering path.

Optimize

Compression tools, smart file format choices, and efficient code will reduce the volume of critical bytes and shorten download times.

Reorder

Set all critical assets to download as early as possible to shorten the critical path length.

Win

Bask in the accolades of your clients when their mobile sites generate business and boost customer satisfaction.

Okay, technically that’s five steps. 


Recap

In this course, you learned how loading too many resources up front can create delays in the critical rendering path. 

You then learned a sequence of four steps to streamline the critical path.
